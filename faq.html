            <h1>FAQ</h1>
            <h3>How does it compare to other anti-5G systems?</h3>
            <p>
                There are some
                <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52810220"
                    >anti-5G USB sticks</a
                >
                available on the market...
            </p>
            <p>
                However, your phone is already a mini-computer in your pocket!!
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks to our ground-breaking <b>AI and Machine Learning</b>
                technology, this app
                <b>provides exactly the same results</b>, and it
                <b>works for 3G and 4G too!</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                You can now use this extra money for great things like
                education!
            </p>

            <h3>Does it really work?</h3>
            <p>
                We haven't conducted any "scientific" research and our team has
                absolutely zero knowledge about the topic. We are just
                <a href="https://www.specian.co.uk/">software enginners</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                But you don't need any of that! Just try it and make your own
                opinion! You will find that when you turn it on, it just works!
                You can immediately feel better. There is some strong evidence
                that it could be linked to
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo#Effects">
                    this phenomenon</a
                >. But who knows... "experts"?! Don't be a sheep!
            </p>
            <h3>Why is it free?</h3>
            <p>
                5G toxicity has created a new market. While some people see it
                as an opportunity to take your money, we want to make the world
                a better place. That's why our app is free to use.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our code is 100% open source.
            </p>
            <h3>Are you working on more apps?</h3>
            <p>
                We are currently working on a new app using augmented virtual
                reality (VR) to cancel out the negative effects of vacines on
                children.
            </p>
            <p>
                You must film your child
                <b>during the vaccination process</b> and the app will extract
                the poison waves from the vacine on the video.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Warning!</b> The video must never be deleted, or the negative
                energy it now contains will be released back into your child!
            </p>
            <p>
                Fortunately, we are experts at Cloud hosting management. Your
                files are safe with us. Our A-Z deployment with acid
                transactions database on the blockchain will ensure you never
                lose your data!
            </p>
            <p>
                This app will require 5G to work so make sure you install this
                one first.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some people said it cannot work this way. But these lunatics
                will believe anything, even when the chemtrail evidence is right
                in front of their eyes
            </p>
